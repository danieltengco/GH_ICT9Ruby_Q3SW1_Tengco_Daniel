		<h4 class="text-warning">Synopsis</h4><hr><p>Alice in Borderland stars Kento Yamazaki as young unemployed gamer Ryohei Arisu, whose life changes drastically when he is mysteriously transported to a parallel universe in which he is forced to play a series of twisted games in order to remain alive. There’s no telling who, exactly, is behind these games — Aliens? The government? The 1%? — nor do they know what they’re getting out of it. The leading theory among Alice in Borderland's characters is that the so-called "Borderland" is actually an identical copy of Tokyo, except a huge chunk of the city's enormous population has disappeared. The only thing Arisu and his fellow players know for sure is that they must either play and win these gruesome games or pay with their lives.</p>

			<div class="col-lg-9 text-info"><b>Shuntarō Chishiya</b> is a character that appears early in the story. He’s a cunning medical student who would unscrupulously sacrifice other people to achieve his own goal. He is calm, highly intelligent and manipulative, and analytical at all times, making him a potentially strong Hearts and Diamonds player, even though he claimed to not be suited for Hearts. This allows him to triumph in games that require defeating other players, yet because he declares to be uninterested in understanding the human heart, Diamond games remain his strong suit. His capabilities to remain so calm in dangerous situations stems from the fact that he has no interest in the concept of life, both his own and others.</div>
